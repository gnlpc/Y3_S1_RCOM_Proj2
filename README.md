# RCOM


Project done for the [FEUP Computer Networking course](https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/pt/ucurr_geral.ficha_uc_view?pv_ocorrencia_id=520330)

The project had two main goals, the first one was the development of a FTP protocol based download application.
The second goal of the project was to configure and setup a Network, in which we had to configure a router and a switch. We have reached the goal after some experiments, building it step by step
